I'm very excited to be participating in the upcoming panel on "The War for Talent" on Thursday, March 30th, 2017 and will be discussing how we, at [Improving](http://improving.com), compete in this market to find and growth top talent. My co-panelists, Amy Ross and Royalyn Reid will be sharing their experience and perspectives as well so it will be a great discussion. If you're interested in joining us you can sign up on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/yes-ceo-symposium-spring-2017-tickets-31261389658) and you can learn more details by visiting the [YES website](http://www.yourexecutivesymphony.org/events.html).
