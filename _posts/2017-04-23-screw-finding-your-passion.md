Ran across this post and had to share especially given the alignment with "So Good They Can't Ignore You" (a book I'd rank in my top 5 of all time) [Screw Finding Your Passion](https://markmanson.net/passion)

A few things that stood out:
>The problem isn’t passion. It’s never passion.
>
>It’s priorities.

This is so true - we make time for what's important but when we don't make time, it's because it's not important ENOUGH. It lines up with some recent thinking I've done. When I find myself feeling like there's not time for something, it's usually a good indicator that I've missed it in my priority list. Then what I need to do is ask, "Is this a priority?" and try to honest about it. If it's not, then dump it!

>Look, here’s another slap in the face for you: every job sucks sometimes. There’s no such thing as some passionate activity that you will never get tired of, never get stressed over, never complain about. It doesn’t exist. I am living my dream job (which happened by accident, by the way. I never in a million years planned on this happening; like a kid on a playground I just went and tried it), and I still hate about 30% of it. Some days more.

This is the "every job has bedpans" (as the nurses teach us) mentality that so many people miss. There's so much work that each of us do on a regular basis that no one else sees and it's probably a beating for us to even get through it. But that's the job. That's what we signed up for. And, yeah, some days 30% feels like a really low number...

Finally, this one:
>And the real truth is that you already enjoy something. You already enjoy many things. You’re just choosing to ignore them.

So what am I ignoring? What is it that I can find joy in that I'm missing the opportunity to appreciate? In the end, it's this appreciation, this joy, that truly fuels me. Especially when I'm slogging thru that 30% bullshit trying to make things go.
