Family
------
{% include image.html class="right" img="crazy_kids.jpg" %} My kids come first. They are my #1 priority and nothing will ever get in the way of that. I have 3 awesome kids and we are blessed to be living in Frisco - amongst our family and friends and we enjoy all that the area has to offer.

Career
------
I don't ascribe to the belief that we can truly separate who we are from what we do provided we have found the thing we
were meant to do. If you don't love your job, you're doing it wrong. I love what I do. It's not without it's challenges
and trials but that's also what motivates me. There's a quote from Dr. J, "Being a professional is doing the things you love to do on the days you don't feel like doing them." and that's how I feel about my work. In 2007 I discovered the folks at [Improving](http://improving.com) and I'm so excited to see how far we have come and where we are going as a
company. It's truly different than any other company I've worked for.
